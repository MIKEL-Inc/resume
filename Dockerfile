# Bypass package.json â€˜s start command and bake it directly into the image itself. So instead of
# $ CMD ["npm","start"]
# you would use something like
# $ CMD ["node","server.js"]
# in your Dockerfile CMD.
# This reduces the number of processes running inside the container and it also
# causes exit signals such as SIGTERM and SIGINT to be received by the Node.js process
# instead of npm swallowing them.
